/*
9. Cyborg Data Type Sizes
You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer. In order to accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes the following data types use: char, int, float, and double. You do not have any technical documenta- tion, so you canâ€™t look this information up. Write a C++ program that will determine the amount of memory used by these types and display the information on the screen.
