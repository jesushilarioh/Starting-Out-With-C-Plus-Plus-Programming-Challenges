*	018. POPULATION BAR CHART
*
*   Write a program that produces a bar chart 
*   showing the population growth of Prairieville, 
*   a small town in the Midwest, at 20-year intervals 
*   during the past 100 years. The program should 
*   read in the population figures (rounded to the 
*   nearest 1,000 people) for 1900, 1920, 1940, 1960, 
*   1980, and 2000 from a file. For each year it should 
*   display the date and a bar consisting of one 
*   asterisk for each 1,000 people. The data can be 
*   found in the People.txt file.
*
*   Here is an example of how the chart might begin:
*
*   PRAIRIEVILLE POPULATION GROWTH 
*   (each * represents 1,000 people) 
*   1900 **
*   1920 ****
*   1940 *****
