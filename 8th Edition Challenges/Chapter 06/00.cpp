/**
 *  Here is the assignment: Write a program that calculates 
 * and displays the total travel expenses of a businessperson 
 * on a trip. The program should have functions that ask for 
 * and return the following:
 * 
 * • The total number of days spent on the trip
 * • The time of departure on the first day of the trip, and 
 *      the time of arrival back home on the last day of the trip
 * • The amount of any round-trip airfare
 * • The amount of any car rentals
 * • Miles driven, if a private vehicle was used. Calculate the 
 *      vehicle expense as $0.27 per mile driven
 * • Parking fees (The company allows up to $6 per day. Anything in 
 *      excess of this must be paid by the employee.)
 * • Taxi fees, if a taxi was used anytime during the trip (The 
 *      company allows up to $10 per day, for each day a taxi was 
 *      used. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the employee.)
 * • Conference or seminar registration fees
 * • Hotel expenses (The company allows up to $90 per night for 
 *      lodging. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the 
 *      employee.)
 * • The amount of each meal eaten. On the first day of the trip, 
 *      breakfast is allowed as an expense if the time of departure is 
 *      before 7 a.m. Lunch is allowed if the time of departure is before 
 *      12 noon. Dinner is allowed on the first day if the time of departure 
 *      is before 6 p.m. On the last day of the trip, breakfast is allowed 
 *      if the time of arrival is after 8 a.m. Lunch is allowed if the time 
 *      of arrival is after 1 p.m. Dinner is allowed on the last day if the 
 *      time of arrival is after 7 p.m. The program should only ask for the 
 *      amounts of allowable meals. (The company allows up to $9 for 
 *      breakfast, $12 for lunch, and $16 for dinner. Anything in excess 
 *      of this must be paid by the employee.)
 * 
 * The program should calculate and display the total expenses incurred by the 
 * businessperson, the total allowable expenses for the trip, the excess that 
 * must be reimbursed by the businessperson, if any, and the amount saved 
 * by the businessperson if the expenses were under the total allowed.
 * 
 * Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for any dollar 
 * amount or for miles driven in a private vehicle. Do not accept 
 * numbers less than 1 for the number of days. Only accept valid 
 * times for the time of departure and the time of arrival.
