14. Lottery Application
Write a program that simulates a lottery. The program should have an array of five integers named lottery and should generate a random number in the range of 0 through 9 for each element in the array. The user should enter five digits, which should be stored in an integer array named user. The program is to compare the correspond- ing elements in the two arrays and keep a count of the digits that match. For example, the following shows the lottery array and the user array with sample numbers stored in each. There are two matching digits (elements 2 and 4).

lottery array:
74913

user array:
42973

The program should display the random numbers stored in the lottery array and the number of matching digits. If all of the digits match, display a message proclaiming the user as a grand prize winner.
